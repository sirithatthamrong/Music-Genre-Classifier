# Music Genre Classifier by Multinomial Logistic Regression
This project was completed as part of the term assignment for ICCS205: Numerical Computation by Kanladaporn Sirithatthamrong and Chada Kengradomying.

## Overview
The project focuses on employing Multinomial Logistic Regression for the classification of music genres. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of genres, including Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, and Rock.

The dataset utilized in this project is derived from the `features_30_sec.csv` file. This file contains a comprehensive set of features relevant to the musical characteristics of each track, forming the foundation for our exploration and application of Multinomial Logistic Regression in music genre classification.

To ensure robust model evaluation, the dataset is partitioned into two subsets: 80% for training and 20% for testing. This division enables the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training while maintaining an independent subset for rigorous assessment during testing.

As we wrap up our project, we're checking how well our Multinomial Logistic Regression model works in guessing music genres and also compare it with other methods like XGBoost and Neural Networks to see which one does the best job. This comparison helps us understand the strengths and weaknesses of each method in sorting music into different genres.
