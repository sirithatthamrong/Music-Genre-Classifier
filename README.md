# Music Genre Classifier by Multinomial Logistic Regression
This project was completed as part of the term assignment for ICCS205: Numerical Computation by Kanladaporn Sirithatthamrong and Chada Kengradomying.

## Overview
The project focuses on employing Multinomial Logistic Regression for the classification of music genres. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of genres, including Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, and Rock.

To ensure robust model evaluation, the dataset is partitioned into two subsets: 80% for training and 20% for testing. This division enables the model to learn patterns from the majority of the data during training while maintaining an independent subset for rigorous assessment during testing.
